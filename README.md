# Coolike
Coolike is a *cheese* add-on for [Cookie Clicker](https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/). It enables a variety of features to help those wishing to make aspects of the game easier. Some features provided are also done by other tools or the built in debug menus, however, this add-on simplifies some of those and does not award the "Cheated cookies taste awful" achievement.
